# README	General information
* Unified Bootloader Host Application 
- Used with the MCC Bootloader Generated Software Library for 8-bit or 16-bit MCU devices, or the 32-bit AN1388 bootloader.
- The graphical front-end of the 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit Bootloader project.

# Support
Email: MCC_Support@microchip.com
This application requires the Java 1.8 runtime.
For the required Java FX support, and an alternative source to the legacy Java installer can be found here:
Azul Zulu Community OpenJDK with OpenJFX is recommended; OpenJFX is required for use with UBHA.
https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?&version=java-8-lts&package=jdk-fx 

Ensure to select the appropriate operating system, and architecture (32/64 bit).

v 1.19.0:   Add LIN support for PIC24/dsPIC devices. Fix issue causing readback errors when only a partial instruction worth of data is specified in the .hex file.

# NEWS	A basic changelog, intended for users
-Incremented version information; see Changelog
-Added readme file on release of version: 0.1.14
-Added Checksum support for PIC32
-Bug fixes, Added Release Notes v 0.1.15 along with readme file. Added support for up to 32-bit checksum value calculation.
-Added Synch Byte expectation to AVR packet support.
-Fixed Typo in Help-->About text which indicated incorrect Utility version
-Added logger support requires launching from command prompt with below text:
* -Djava.util.logging.config.file="C:\<DirectoryLocation>"
- Bugfix for 16-bit flash write.

# Known Issues
- When using a version of java greater than v1.8.0_251, selecting a UART COM port and selecting "Apply" causes the Unified Bootloader Host Application to crash. In order to avoid this please ensure to use
a version of java at or below version 1.8.0_251. 
- The warning 'Application Offset exist between ROWS/PAGE boundaries' might be shown incorrectly, even though the application offset is at the start of a page. Please make sure that the application start adress is at the beginning of a page by referring to the device datasheet.

# Debug Log
The UBHA supports the ability to view Debug Logger message through use of the packaged logging.properties file.
i.e.: To Launch from Command Prompt
>java -Djava.util.logging.config.file="<Drive: e.g. C>:\<MyDirectory>\<UnifiedHost-version>\logging.properties" -jar UnifiedHost-<version>.jar
